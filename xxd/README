xxd challenge
-------------

This is my xxd command reimplementation, for the "Build your own Xxd" challenge (https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-xxd).

Implementation notes
--------------------

STEP 1:

Nothing really special in this step, just reading the input file and printing it in hexadecimal format.

STEP 2:

It starts to get interesting now. The first thing to do is to parse the arguments.
The Peekable<I> trait is very helpful in this case, I just have to peek the next token for the value if we see the "-g" param.

The second thing is to modify the print function to use the config values.

Funny, for the group size, all I have to change is just pass the group size as chunk size for the Vec::chunks method.

I thought the little endian part will be tricky, but turned out it's not. We just need to print each chunk in reversed order.

But printing spaces before the ASCII part of the output was confusing at first, it's not documented anywhere, but I guees, if we are printing in little endian, we will need more spaces than printing in big endian mode. For more readable output.
