xxd challenge
-------------

This is my xxd command reimplementation, for the "Build your own Xxd" challenge (https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-xxd).

Implementation notes
--------------------

STEP 1:

Nothing really special in this step, just reading the input file and printing it in hexadecimal format.

STEP 2:

It starts to get interesting now. The first thing to do is to parse the arguments.
The Peekable<I> trait is very helpful in this case, I just have to peek the next token for the value if we see the "-g" param.

The second thing is to modify the print function to use the config values.

Funny, for the group size, all I have to change is just pass the group size as chunk size for the Vec::chunks method.

The little endian part gonna be a little tricky.
